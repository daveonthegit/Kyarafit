# Kyarafit

Kyarafit is a mobile-first cosplay wardrobe and outfit planning application.  
It helps cosplayers track builds, manage their closet, design character coords, and receive notifications about new drops and restocks from their favorite shops.

---

## Overview

Kyarafit is designed for cosplayers, fashion hobbyists, and content creators who need a single platform to:

- Organize and catalog costume pieces, props, and wigs.
- Plan and visualize character coords with a layered editor.
- Track build progress, budgets, and WIP status.
- Save product links and receive restock alerts.
- Generate convention packing lists and schedules.

---

## Features (MVP)

- **Closet Management** – Upload and auto-cutout costume pieces, wigs, and props.
- **Build Tracking** – Group items by character and track progress from idea to completion.
- **Coord Builder** – Drag-and-drop pieces into a layered canvas to plan outfits.
- **Wishlist and Alerts** – Add product URLs, monitor stock status, and get notified on restocks.
- **Convention Mode** – Create day-by-day cosplay plans and packing lists.
- **Offline Ready** – Access wardrobe and build data without internet connectivity.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Go 1.21+
- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### 🚀 One-Command Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Kyarafit
./setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Check all requirements
- Install dependencies
- Setup environment files
- Start PostgreSQL database
- Run database migrations
- Build all services

### Manual Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Web app
   cd web && npm install
   
   # Mobile app
   cd ../mobile && npm install
   
   # Backend
   cd ../backend && go mod tidy
   
   # Image service
   cd ../image-service && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Setup environment files:**
   ```bash
   cp web/env.example web/.env
   cp mobile/env.example mobile/.env
   cp backend/env.example backend/.env
   cp image-service/env.example image-service/.env
   ```

3. **Start database:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   ```

4. **Setup database schema:**
   ```bash
   cd web && npx prisma db push
   ```

5. **Start all services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Development URLs

- **Mobile App:** Scan QR code with Expo Go
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:8080/api/v1
- **Image Service:** http://localhost:8001
- **Database:** localhost:5432

### API Endpoints

- **Backend API:** `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`
- **Image Service:** `http://localhost:8001`
- **Health Checks:** 
  - Backend: `GET /health`
  - Image Service: `GET /health`

### Database

PostgreSQL runs on `localhost:5432` with:
- Database: `kyarafit`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Fly.io (Recommended)

1. **Install Fly CLI:**
   ```bash
   curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
   flyctl auth login
   ```

2. **Deploy services:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && flyctl deploy
   
   # Web app
   cd ../web && flyctl deploy
   
   # Image service
   cd ../image-service && flyctl deploy
   ```

3. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   flyctl secrets set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." -a kyarafit-backend
   flyctl secrets set JWT_SECRET="your-secret" -a kyarafit-backend
   ```

### Render

1. **Connect GitHub repository to Render**
2. **Use the included `render.yaml` configuration**
3. **Set environment variables in Render dashboard**

### Docker Compose (Production)

```bash
# Build and start all services
